# YeetClub-CP
This repository contains a cross-platform implementation of Santafebound's YeetClub application, and is made in C# .NET with Xamarin.
The source code from Santafebound's YeetClub application, written in Java, was converted into C# syntax using Sinairv's Jeton application.
It is currently being modified to work properly as a XAMARIN C# .NET Cross-Platform project.

In order to develop this project, you must have either Visual Studio 2017 RC with Xamarin (installable through the Visual Studio 2017 RC 
installer) on a windows machine and a macOS machine running XCode, or a macOS machine with Xamarin Studio and XCode.

Visual Studio 2017 RC is a free product downloadable via any of Microsoft's online marketplaces except for the Windows Store.
Xamarin Studio is also a free product downloadable via the Xamarin website.

The source code present on this repository can be copied and modified, or sold, given that Santafebound and Thefanatr are both credited, 
and Santafebound's lisence terms are complied with.

Please test all major changes made to the source code in a branch, or fork a version to mess around with, then merge the changes into the 
master branch.

As of January 28th 2017, the source code does not build an operable program, as it is currently composed of solely the output from the 
raw syntax conversion from Java to C# and a Xamarin Cross-Platform Native UI Public Class Library project template built into 
Visual Studio 2017 RC.

Information on how the application is supposed to perform, the application's purpose, as well as a working android-only example version 
can be found on Santafebound's yeetclub-android repository.

All help is greatly appreciated!
